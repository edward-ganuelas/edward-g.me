        <p>My name is Edward Paulo Nilmar Ganuelas. I was born the first of five children in Manila, Philippines and grew up in Quezon City. In 2005, me and my family migrated to Canada and have been living here ever since. As a child, I have always been interested in computers and programming due to my early love of video games. When I was a kid, our parents bought us a Nintendo Famicom (or the NES in the west) and because of that I asked for a programming book for christmas, intending to make a video game.</p>
        <p>Currently, I'm a web developer. My hobbies include video games, photography (mostly on film), working out, basketball, listening to music and watching pro wrestling. </p>

        <p>I like music, I listen to music everyday to switch modes or prepare for a certain mindset. If I'm working on a mundane tasks I keep it on to keep my head energized. I also listen to music to prepare myself so that I can focus and ususally when I reach that state then the music stops.</p>
        <p>I listen to all kinds of music though I primarily listent to classic Rock and Rap. I sometimes listen to Disney music and I'm not particulary found of EDM or country. </p>
        <p>Some of my favorite classic acts are AC/DC, Queen, Tupac, and Eminem</p>
        <p>I'm one of the rare unicorns that uses Google Play Music and the following playlist is my auto 'Thumbs Up' playlist, a collection of random song from different genres and different artist. The way the playlist works is that songs in the top of the list is the newest one I liked.</p>
