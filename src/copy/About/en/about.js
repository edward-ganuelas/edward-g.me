        paragraph1: `My name is Edward Paulo Nilmar Ganuelas. 
        I was born the first of five children in Manila, Philippines and grew up in Quezon City. 
        In 2005, me and my family migrated to Canada and have been living here ever since. 
        As a child, I have always been interested in computers and programming due to my early love of video games. 
        When I was a kid, our parents bought us a Nintendo Famicom (or the NES in the west) and because of that I asked for a programming book for christmas, 
        intending to make a video game.`,
